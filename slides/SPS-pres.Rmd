# Introduction

- Incorporating school journeys into the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT)



- STARS - Sustainable transport access to rail stations



- ACTON - Active transport options for new developments


---

# Travel to schools

- The PCT started off with commute data only, although this only represents around a third of cycle trips

- School travel data was added in 2019

- There are striking contrasts in terms of where people are cycling, with school trips better at representing local and suburban journeys 

- 3.3% of commutes are cycled in England, but only 1.3% of trips for education/escort education and <1% for personal business and shopping (Aldred 2019)

- In Netherlands, women cycle more than men

# Aims of STARS: 

- Establish the potential for cycling to stations in the STARS study area

- Inform investment decisions regarding cycle infrastructure and cycle parking at stations

- Feed into monitoring and evaluation of cycling levels

???

Around 2/3rd of trips are within 5 miles.
Many of these are cyclable, especially when considering Ebikes.
But how to get people cycling who commute longer distances, e.g. those living in the commuter belts outside London?

Modal shift to cycling under future scenarios
Identify roads which may benefit from improved cycle infrastructure
Estimate the number of cycle parking spaces required at stations
Can identify potential monitoring sites and provide a baseline against which to assess cycling uptake

664,000 people in 1,200 km2

Moderate population density (~500 ppl/km2 vs ~400 in England)

Relatively even distribution of stations

For interactive map see [here](http://rpubs.com/RobinLovelace/536607)

Cyclable distances (~3.5 km population-weighted mean to stations)

"train is the only practical method for getting to work for many people" (Phase I report)

See [here](http://rpubs.com/RobinLovelace/536634) for interactive map

Around half of all commutes are within Bedfordshire

The majority of these are to the nearest town centre, but there is some inter-town travel

# Data sources

- 2011 census data

- 2017-18 ORR Estimates of Station Usage 

- 2018 travel survey of Bedfordshire Midland Main Line stations

- Cyclestreets routing API

- PCT travel to work scenarios

- CyIPT street level cycle infrastructure data

# Methodology


- Identify trips that could be made by cycle/PT combination

- Estimate travel to stations, currently (and potential?)

- Estimate the potential for those trips to be cycled

- Combine with cycling potential for other trip purposes

- Visualise results to inform decision-making process

- Assess specific interventions

These desire lines show MSOA commute data for all journeys starting in Bedfordshire where at least 20 people travel by rail

# Identification of public transport trips

.pull-left[

## Phase I

- Start with Census OD data
- Transport API used to find if trip could arrive by 9:00 AM
- Fastest train journey used (see [here](http://rpubs.com/RobinLovelace/536826))
- Not simply routing cyclists to the nearest station, but takes account of their final destination 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/bedford-rnet-rail-geom-phase1.png")
```


]

.pull-right[

## Phase II 

- Start with commutes that are already made by rail
- Use CycleStreets API to identify shortest overall journey time for cycle/rail combination
- Based on home-rail trip, estimate potential for trip to be cycled


Next steps

- Estimate travel-to-station levels for non commute trips based on local survey data
- Use knowledge of capacity to estimate growth

- Feasibility assessment of route options 
- Explore other interventions
- [Overlay](http://rpubs.com/RobinLovelace/536834) with commuter and educational trip potential
- Create integrated layer of cycling potential
- Extend Phase I cycle parking analysis
- Training / workshop
- National deployment of cycling-transport layer
- calculate with route network distance minimised
