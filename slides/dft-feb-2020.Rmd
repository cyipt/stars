# Aims of STARS: 

- Establish the potential for cycling to stations in the STARS study area

- Inform investment decisions regarding cycle infrastructure and cycle parking at stations

- Feed into monitoring and evaluation of cycling levels

```

???

Around 2/3rd of trips are within 5 miles.
Many of these are cyclable, especially when considering Ebikes.
But how to get people cycling who commute longer distances, e.g. those living in the commuter belts outside London?

Modal shift to cycling under future scenarios
Identify roads which may benefit from improved cycle infrastructure
Estimate the number of cycle parking spaces required at stations
Can identify potential monitoring sites and provide a baseline against which to assess cycling uptake

664,000 people in 1,200 km2

Moderate population density (~500 ppl/km2 vs ~400 in England)

Relatively even distribution of stations

For interactive map see [here](http://rpubs.com/RobinLovelace/536607)

Cyclable distances (~3.5 km population-weighted mean to stations)

See [here](http://rpubs.com/RobinLovelace/536634) for interactive map

Around half of all commutes are within Bedfordshire

The majority of these are to the nearest town centre, but there is some inter-town travel

# Data sources

- Transport API

- PCT travel to work scenarios

- CyIPT street level cycle infrastructure data

- 2017-18 ORR Estimates of Station Usage

# Methodology

- Use 2011 Census data on mode of travel to work

- Identify trips that could be made by cycle/PT combination

- Estimate travel to individual stations

- Estimate the potential for those trips to be cycled

- Visualise results to inform decision-making process

These desire lines show MSOA commute data for all journeys starting in Bedfordshire where at least 20 people travel by rail

# Identification of public transport trips

.pull-left[

## Phase I

- Start with rail commutes both to and from Bedfordshire
- Use Transport API to identify the 3 fastest options to arrive by 9:00 AM
- Fastest train journey used (see [here](http://rpubs.com/RobinLovelace/536826))
- Not simply routing cyclists to the nearest station, but takes account of their final destination 
- Based on home-rail trip, estimate potential for trip to be cycled


]

--

.pull-right[

## Phase II 

- Start with rail commutes by Bedfordshire residents
- Only include those who live within 5 km of one of ten mainline rail stations
- Use CycleStreets API to identify shortest on-road distance from home to station
- Route all journeys to the nearest station
- Based on home-rail trip, estimate potential for trip to be cycled

# Cycling takeup rates


```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyipt/stars/master/figures/takeup-by-phase.png")
```

- Our Phase 2 results pick up 89% of current rail commutes

- Phase 2 sees more journeys from most mainline stations, except Luton

- Potential cycle takeup is 11-23% under Phase 1; 38-42% under Phase 2

- Some stations could have >1200 cycle commuter journeys


---

# Phase 2 suggestions: Luton

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyipt/stars/master/figures/cyipt-existing-luton.png")
```

- Existing cycle infrastructure around Luton and Leagrave is relatively limited; our results support route development here

- Close agreement with several of the cycle routes proposed in the 'Luton Cycling Opportunities' report

---

# Phase 2 suggestions: Luton

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyipt/stars/master/figures/go-dutch-luton.png")
```

# Route busyness

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyipt/stars/master/figures/leagreave-busyness-highlighted.png")
```

- There may be particular route segments or dangerous junctions that act as barriers preventing cycling

---

# Phase 2 suggestions: Bedford

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyipt/stars/master/figures/cyipt-existing-bedford.png")
```

- Bedford appears to have fairly extensive cycle infrastructure, but not in the immediate station vicinity 
- Develop routes from the station entrance to enable links southwards across the River Great Ouse, eastwards through the town centre, and north to link to existing cycle provision

# Phase 2 suggestions: Bedford

### Arlesey, Biggleswade and Sandy

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyipt/stars/master/figures/go-dutch-abs.png")
```

]

.pull-right[

### Central Bedfordshire suggestions

- route between Leighton Buzzard station and the town centre 

- route between Ampthill and Flitwick

- routes from Arlesey station to nearby towns and villages 

- the B1042 between Potton and Sandy

# How many cycle spaces do we need?

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyipt/stars/master/figures/cycle-spaces.png")
```
- Remember that only 47% of rail journeys in England are for commuting
- Must also consider the need for cycle spaces at specific station entrances
- Consider improvements such as secure cycle hubs, cycle hire, and improved cycle carriage on trains

---

# Potential future work

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyipt/stars/master/slides/multipurpose-thin.png")
```

- Combine with cycling potential for other trip purposes, to create integrated cycle potential layer
- [Overlay](http://rpubs.com/RobinLovelace/536834) with commuter and educational trip potential
- Estimate travel-to-station levels for non commute trips 
- Account for multiple station entrances
- Use local survey data
- Assess specific interventions
- Training / workshop
- Either improve the existing methods to better represent certain journey types (E.g. travel to Bedfordshire), or develop a Phase 3 method that directly models cycle-rail journeys. 


---

# Our Recommendations

- All mainline Bedfordshire stations could see substantial increases in cycle commuting; Luton, Leagrave and Bedford stations could all see >1200 cycle commuters per day

- Luton station is especially under-used by cyclists at present, and there is also a particular need to reduce air pollution here

- Bedford, Leagrave and Leighton Buzzard could all benefit from safe cycle routes in the immediate vicinity of the stations

- Use these results to guide future surveys, and examine monitoring programme outputs to identify barriers that may prevent cycling in certain areas

- Consider investing in cycle routes to stations as part of a wider network of routes that are convenient, high-quality and safe for all to use

- Consider investing in improved cycle facilities at stations
