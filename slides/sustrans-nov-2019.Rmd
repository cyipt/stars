Robin to do this bit

Around 2/3rd of trips are within 5 miles.
Many of these are cyclable, especially when considering Ebikes.
But how to get people cycling who commute longer distances, e.g. those living in the commuter belts outside London?

Modal shift to cycling under future scenarios
Identify roads which may benefit from improved cycle infrastructure
Estimate the number of cycle parking spaces required at stations
Can identify potential monitoring sites and provide a baseline against which to assess cycling uptake

664,000 people in 1,200 km2

Moderate population density (~500 ppl/km2 vs ~400 in England)

Relatively even distribution of stations

For interactive map see [here](http://rpubs.com/RobinLovelace/536607)

Cyclable distances (~3.5 km population-weighted mean to stations)

- Transport planning is a **democratic process**

--

- For democracies to work **participation is vital**

--

- So important that the public can participate, with different levels making participation accessible for all, including:
    - Lowest barrier to entry: interactive web tool
    - Mid level: Place to interact with the planning process (e.g. comment on map)
    - High level: Access to data
    - Advanced users: Open source software

See [here](http://rpubs.com/RobinLovelace/536634) for interactive map

Around half of all commutes are within Bedfordshire

The majority of these are to the nearest town centre, but there is some inter-town travel

# Data sources

- 2011 census data

- 2017-18 ORR Estimates of Station Usage 

- 2018 travel survey of Bedfordshire Midland Main Line stations

- Cyclestreets routing API

- PCT travel to work scenarios

- CyIPT street level cycle infrastructure data

# Methodology


- Identify trips that could be made by cycle/PT combination

- Estimate travel to stations, currently (and potential?)

- Estimate the potential for those trips to be cycled

- Combine with cycling potential for other trip purposes

- Visualise results to inform decision-making process

- Assess specific interventions

These desire lines show MSOA commute data for all journeys starting in Bedfordshire where at least 20 people travel by rail

# Identification of public transport trips

.pull-left[

## Phase I

- Start with Census OD data
- Transport API used to find if trip could arrive by 9:00 AM
- Fastest train journey used (see [here](http://rpubs.com/RobinLovelace/536826))
- Not simply routing cyclists to the nearest station, but takes account of their final destination 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyipt/stars/master/figures/bedford-rnet-rail-geom-phase1.png")
```


]

.pull-right[

## Phase II 

- Start with commutes that are already made by rail
- Use OpenTripPlanner to identify shortest overall journey time for cycle/rail combination
- Based on home-rail trip, estimate potential for trip to be cycled


Next steps

- Estimate travel-to-station levels for non commute trips based on local survey data
- Use knowledge of capacity to estimate growth

# Survey data

- modal share at each station in bedfordshire. Do we include the Luton stations?
- station usage over time

# Survey data analysis

Luton Airport Parkway is less dominated by commuter journeys than other stations

The ORR data is from the Estimates of Station Usage for 2017-18 (the most recent year available)
The survey data is from 27-29th Nov 2018, collected on a single day between the hours of 05:30-10:30am at each station. 
Luton Airport Parkway is not used much for commuting, so we can expect the survey data (collected during the morning peak) to show lower usage than ORR data (representing total annual usage)

This routes commutes to the major Bedfordshire stations only (as shown in previous slide) using the Cyclestreets routing API and the PCT 'Go Dutch' scenario
Journeys are to the nearest station 'as the crow flies'

- Feasibility assessment of route options + other interventions
- [Overlay](http://rpubs.com/RobinLovelace/536834) with commuter and educational trip potential
- Create integrated layer of cycling potential
- Extend Phase I cycle parking analysis
- Training / workshop
- National deployment of cycling-transport layer
