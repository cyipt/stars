Survey was carried out by Praxis. Keith is still working out with them exactly how some of the numbers were reached.

In Luton, there's a footbridge to a multi-story car park. They assumed all car park users and all people walking into the car park were station users. But some people may just use the footbridge to walk into town.

In Bedford, the bus stop for buses going into town is a little way down the road, and some bus passengers taking the bus from the station into town may have been missed.

Keith will send me:
- more camera locations
- update on Luton issues and more detail in assigning station entry/exits
