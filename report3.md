# 1 Combined network data

The combined layer is shown in Figure <a href="#fig:combined">1.1</a>
(see

Summary statistics of the route network data, showing the relative
importance of commute, school and travel to stations trips for potential
(under the Go Dutch scenario) and current (for commute and school
travel) is shown in Table <a href="#tab:sumtabthousands">1.1</a>.

| lad\_name            | commute | school | stations | all | commute\_2011 | school\_2011 |
|:---------------------|--------:|-------:|---------:|----:|--------------:|-------------:|
| Bedford              |     407 |    244 |       18 | 669 |            69 |           17 |
| Central Bedfordshire |     242 |    314 |       26 | 583 |            28 |            9 |
| Luton                |     413 |    293 |       34 | 740 |            30 |            4 |

Table 1.1: Relative importance if different trip purposes for cycling
potential in local authorities in Bedfordshire. Cycling potential and
current (2011 data, a proxy for current cycling levels) cycling levels
is measured in thousand km cycled on the network for a typical
work/school day (one way).

The spatial distribution of each network is shown in Figure
<a href="#fig:distribution">1.2</a>.[1]
