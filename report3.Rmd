# Analysis of counter data

We analysed DfT's manual traffic count data for the study region to trends in motor and cycling traffic.

```{r}
d_las %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(year, relative_traffic, group = local_authority_name), colour = "grey") +
  geom_line(aes(year, relative_traffic, colour = local_authority_name), data = d_las_of_interest, size = 1.2) +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```

```{r}
knitr::kable(d_change, caption = "Network length and change in motor traffic between 2011 for Bedfordshire regions")
```



# Combined network data

The combined layer is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:combined) (see [rpubs.com/RobinLovelace/695513](https://rpubs.com/RobinLovelace/695513) for interactive version of map).

```{r combined, fig.cap="Cycling potential in Luton: combined commute, school and stations layers."}
knitr::include_graphics("https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1825120/100157908-40677100-2ea3-11eb-8de7-445adfc3ecef.png")
```

Summary statistics of the route network data, showing the relative importance of commute, school and travel to stations trips for potential (under the Go Dutch scenario) and current (for commute and school travel) is shown in Table \@ref(tab:sumtabthousands).

```{r sumtabthousands}
knitr::kable(sumtab_thousands, caption = "Relative importance if different trip purposes for cycling potential in local authorities in Bedfordshire. Cycling potential and current (2011 data, a proxy for current cycling levels) cycling levels is measured in thousand km cycled on the network for a typical work/school day (one way).")
```

The spatial distribution of each network is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:distribution).^[
